# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe (X/O) game for two players.
 
 ### Game Rules:
 
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.

Player 1 is X, and Player 2 is O.

Players take turns placing their mark in an empty cell.

The first player to align three marks vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins.

If all 9 cells are filled with no winner, the game ends in a draw.
